Externalizing Microservices Properties Developed By **Gbenga Ogunkuade** ðŸ™‚

This mini PROJECT consists of 6 Microservices
- Gateway Server
- Discovery Server
- Config Server
- Employee Service
- Address Service
- Service Consumer

The goal of this mini project is to show how you can easily externalize microservices properties.

- What this means is storing the configuration and other properties of microservices outside of the codebase, in a centralized location such as a configuration server or a cloud-based service. 

- Successful implementation of this approach enables microservices to be easily configured and managed without having to rebuild and redeploy the entire system.

- This reduces the risk of errors caused by hard-coding configuration values in the code.
